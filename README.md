### Factorial Design Study - Impact of Tag and Medium on RSSI (Skills: SAS, ANOVA, A/B Testing, Experimental Design)
<ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>Researched main and interaction effects, compared mean differences in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value by conducting two factor ANOVA.</ul>
<ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>Conducted statistical study to determine effects of medium on RFID tags performance.</ul>
<uln style=“list-style-type:disc”>Performed residual analysis to check model assumptions, used Variance stabilization technique to resolve issues of heteroskedasticity and non-normality in the model.</ul>
