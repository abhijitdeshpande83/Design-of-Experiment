# Design-of-Experiment
### Factorial Design Study - Impact of Tag and Medium on RSSI (Skills: SAS, ANOVA, A/B Testing, Experimental Design)
- Researched main and interaction effects, compared mean differences in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value by conducting two factor ANOVA.
- Conducted statistical study to determine effects of medium on RFID tags performance.
- Performed residual analysis to check model assumptions, used Variance stabilization technique to resolve issues of heteroskedasticity and non-normality in the model.
